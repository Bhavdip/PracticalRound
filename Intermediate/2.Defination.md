## Develop a simple Timer application for Android Platform, App is called TTimer.

TTimer is design for the user who want to track their daily task.Main goal of application is to allow a userfor log time when he/she is start and stop any task.It is simple application, in first iteration we will give a option for save a record in local database. Application is completely work offline.

At a single point of time application can only run single task. User can enter the title of the task and click start button that will start clock and run until user stop it. Application keep running a task until user manully stop it even if user close and kill the application it will continue run a task in background.

If user reopen the application, show consumed time or running timer with the title of task. User can stop timer any time, app will save or update task record in local db.


**Iteration 2** 

As we mentionded previously app is running a timer in background if user kill or close the an application, it will automatically show timer in notification area, where user can pause,stop and restart the task. Click on notification task bar will launch the application.

**Iteration 3** 
- We can give our user to an option for edit or restart or deleted any previously ended task anytime.

**Good Luck & Happy coding**
